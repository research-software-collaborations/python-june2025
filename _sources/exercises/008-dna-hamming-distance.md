# 008 - Counting Point Mutations

Given two strings s and t of equal length, the Hamming distance between s and t, denoted $d_H(s,t)$, is the number of corresponding symbols that differ in s and t.

This is a concrete example of the [Counting Point Mutations](https://rosalind.info/problems/hamm/) problem on the [Rosalind bioinformatics problems website](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/).

The downloadable data for the [human insulin gene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3630) (in particular the gene.fna "FASTA" file) contains two different reference genome assemblies of the same length. Calculate the Hamming Distance between them.
