# 106 - Madhava-Leibniz series for $\pi$

Implement a function to calculate $\pi$ using the first N terms of the series:

$\Large \displaystyle\frac{\pi}{4} = \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{11} + \cdots$ 

Tasks:
  * Make a plot of the result versus the number of terms included for the first 100 terms.
  * Make a plot of the difference of (four times) the series and the true value of $\pi$ for the first 100 terms.
  * How many terms are needed to get within 0.01 of correct answer? 0.001 of the right answer? $10^{-6}$ of the right answer? $\frac{1}{129}$ of the right answer? Do you understand what you see?
