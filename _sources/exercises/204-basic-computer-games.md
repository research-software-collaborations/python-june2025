You can browse (or download a pdf of) [Basic Computer Games (Microcomputer Edition) - 1978](https://archive.org/details/basic-computer-games-microcomputer-edition_202207/mode/2up)

Choose one or more of the games there and implement it in Python. Some classic examples include:

  * Stars - page 153 (page 168 in the pdf)
  * Flip Flop - page 63 (page 78 in the pdf)
  * Hammurabi - page 78 (page 93 in the pdf)
  * Stock Market - page 154 (page 169 in the pdf)
  * Amazing - page 3 (page 18 in the pdf)
  * Super Star Trek - page 157 (page 172 in the pdf)

If you want to translate from BASIC, you can browse (or download a pdf of) [Computer Programming in Basic For Everyone (Radio Shack) - 1973](https://archive.org/details/Computer_Programming_in_BASIC_for_Everyone_1973_Houghton_Miflin).
