# 203 - World Bank Data

The World Bank has an online database called [DataBank](https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&country=NLD#) which provides 
world development indicators by country. (The link takes you to an example for the Netherlands.) You can download CSV files with the data. 
Using the selection menu on the left, get the population statistics for a number of countries and make various plots, e.g. showing the evolution 
over time, pie chart with fractions of total, etc.
