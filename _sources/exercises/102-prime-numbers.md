# 102 - Prime Numbers

Write a program to calculate the first 50 prime numbers.

The answer is of course known and is {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229}. Your challenge here is to write the program to find them. Do not worry for the moment about writing an *efficient* program, since this is a small number of primes. Implement a single algorithm that gets correct answers.
