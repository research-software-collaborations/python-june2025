# 108 - Analyze Text

For a given block of text, analyze it to determine:

  * frequency of letters
  * length of words
  * all of the words that are palindromes, order these in alphabetical order and then in order of length
  * a list of all of the words in the text and the number of times they occur, sort these with the most frequent ones first

Make plots of each of these things (sorted). (You can truncate to the top N entries for the last ones if need be.)

You can use any long piece of text you like, for example such as [The Great Gatsby](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/64317/pg64317.txt), which I obtained from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). (This is just an example, please find other long texts which interest you!)

You will need to do a bit of cleanup to avoid various non-word parts of the 
text such as punctation.
