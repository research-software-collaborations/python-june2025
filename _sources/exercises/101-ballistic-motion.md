# 101 - Ballistic Motion

The equations of motion for an object with initial velocity $\vec{v_0} = (v_{0x},v_{0y})$ under the influence of
gravity $(g = 9.8 m/s^2)$ are:

  $$ x = v_{0x} \cdot t$$
  $$ y = v_{0y} \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g \cdot t^{2}$$

**Exercise 1:** Fix the value of $\vert\vec{v_0}\vert$ and make a plot of the trajectories of objects launched at various angles. The 
resulting plot should look something like:

**Exercise 2:**

 * add bounce

**Exercise 3:**
 
 * plot ballistic motion (for various angles) with a round obstacle at some position in the sky, check if the object hits the obstacle and interrupt the trajectory at that point if it does

**Exercise 4:**
 
 * animate ballistic motion
