# Quick Python Reference

  In this section we give abbreviated notes on the basic python features,
syntax and a few common libraries. This review is **not** meant to be 
comprehensive. It is just enough to give you the basics such that you
can start writing code, including in particular some things you can use 
in the exercises.

  We will often link to further documentation on a given feature or
aspect, but in general you also need to learn how to find documentation
as your code journey proceeds. This will be especially true as you
move beyond the core language and most common packages and leverage
the large ecosystem libraries and tools which make Python so powerful.

## General links

  To dive deeper, there are many additional sources of information on the 
web, in github (and related code documentation), in YouTube, etc. 

  Some general examples of python documentation include:

  * [python.org](https://www.python.org) 
    * [python 3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) - comprehensive Python documentation
  * [Python Beginner's Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) - contains lot of links to other documentation
  * [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) - for beginners with Python, but not to programming
  * [Software Carpentries: Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) - introductory Python course
  * [Level Up Your Python](https://henryiii.github.io/level-up-your-python/notebooks/0%20Intro.html) - intermediate Python course
