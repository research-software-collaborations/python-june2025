    "  * **ROOT files** - This is a very common format (from the [ROOT data analysis framework](https://root.cern)) used widely in particle, nuclear and astroparticle physics. They can be opened and manipulated in Python using the [uproot](https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basic.html) library. Uproot is often used with [Awkward Array](https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/getting-started/index.html) to read and access jagged arrays. We will be discussing uproot, ROOT files and Awkward Array in the other HEP-specific parts of this workshop.\n",
    "  * **Parquet files** - as the larger data science community outgrew CSV files, they also needed a binary space-efficient data storage format. [Apache Parquet](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/parquet.html) has been developed to fill that niche and is well integrated with (for example) Pandas.\n",
    "  * **HDF5 files** - Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) files were originally developed with the high performance computing community (at NCSA) and the latest version, HDF5, has been adopted by a number of other scientific domains as well as garnered some [interest within the high energy physics community](https://www.hdfgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Story-of-HDF5-in-High-Energy-Physics.pdf). The [h5py package](https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/) provides a pythonic interface to HDF5 files."
