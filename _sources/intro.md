# Python with Exercises

This course provides a (quick) introduction to Python. We assume 
you have done at least a little programming, but are probably not
doing it every day. 

The primary focus here is on *exercises* rather than long lectures.
You learn by doing. 80% of your time in this course should be spent
either writing code or explaining your solutions to problems.

## Specific course goals

By the end of this course:
  * Given a problem, you should be able to open your laptop and within
    minutes be writing Python code to solve that problem.
  * You will be familiar with all of the core Python language and
    a number of the most important Python ecosystem libraries.
  * You will be familiar with JupyterLab and Jupyter notebooks.
  * You should bet set up in GitHub and be familiar with creating and
    using repositories.
<!--
  * You should have one or more environments set up to do scientific
    programming in python.
  * You should know how to evolve those environments to add new packages
    you want to use and manage multiple environments.

## Skills development: 10, 100, 1000, 10000 hours 

In his book [Outliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)),
author and journalist Malcolm Gladwell famously posited a "10,000
hour rule": that achieving *elite* world-class expertise at a given
skill takes dedicated and focused practice for periods of order
10,000 hours. A PhD (or PhD+postdoc) is arguably a time commitment
of this level!

That said, most of us are not aiming to be the world's leading
expert for some specific given skill (e.g. chess grand master), but
instead to be *competent* at a wide number of skills that taken 
together we need as part of our careers as scientists. An alternative
and perhaps more appropriate goal is then the "100 hour rule", which
stipulates that with 100 hours of dedicated effort we can become
"competent" at these skills. Here "competent" means that one is
qualitatively and noticeably more skilled than a complete novice
at the given skill. You should be comfortable enough with all of 
the basics that you can just "get to work". You are *not* "expert", 
but you know enough to begin to move in the space (here "Python 
programming") and you can do useful things. Most importantly,
it becomes much easier to autonomously incorporate new knowledge 
piecemeal as you practice the skill.

These 10,000 and 100 hour "rules" are clearly just figures of merit
for the order of magnitude of effort required, but they do frame
qualitative goals for us. What does 1000 hours then represent? 
All such things happen on a continuum and vary 
by the particular skill, so who really knows? But "100 hours"
is both doable and you *will* be qualitatively in a different place
in terms of your ability to actually use the skill.  So let's aim
for that!  The most important thing is to note that these rules are
about **active practice**. You need to *exercise* the muscle to
make it stronger.

  This course aims to put you solidly on the road to being a *competent* 
Python programmer and do many things to enable your scientific research.
From there, if you remain open to learning and continue to use the
skill you will naturally evolve into an expert.

## Some tips:

  * **Remember at all times that actual coding is how you make progress, whether towards 100 hours or 10000 hours.**
  * If you need to look up syntax or examples of something in the documentation, on the web or via ChatGPT or similar, do **not** simply cut and paste code from any of those places into your own code. Your goal at the moment is not to be "efficient", it is to learn. (Re)typing the code yourself will force you to think through and understand the code in question.
  * When in doubt as to how something behaves, don't just look it up or ask ChatGPT. Try it! Play with code snippets and simplified code constructions. Use the integrated API help available in Jupyter.
